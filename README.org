* [WIP] Kree - a key remap utility
  A lot of window managers or desktop enviroments offer ways to map keys.
  This is an attempt to offer a solution that can work with any WM / DE.

* Development
** Run
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cargo run
  #+END_SRC
** Install
   Go to the project root and run
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     cargo install --force --path .
   #+END_SRC
   You can run this from your =~/.xinitrc= or =~/.config/i3/config=. For some reason systemd doesn't work...
* Terminology
** Key chord
** Key sequence
** Computer human interface lanuage
* Next steps
** TODO Design basic architechture
   Create a spec for how it should work...
